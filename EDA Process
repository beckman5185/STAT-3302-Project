```

Start of EDA Process
----------------------

From stepAIC, the model below is what was found to be the best fit model for
our data.

```{r}

# Making variable name smaller for GGPairs plot
Deaths_Per_100k <- pollution_deaths$Deaths_Per_100000
Clean_Fuel_Percent <- pollution_deaths$Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent

# Showing the model that will be used for the EDA process
model = glm(formula = Deaths_Per_100k ~ Year * Clean_Fuel_Percent * 
    GDP_Per_Capita * Population, family = "poisson", data = pollution_deaths)

model

```

First, we can ask how do these variables play on each other. Is there any
correlation amongst these variables and how linear are they to one another.

```{r}

# Pairs plot to show correlation between the 5 variables
ggpairs(model, columns = c(1,2,3,4,5), upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 5))) +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8),
        strip.text.y = element_text(size = 5.5))

```

Looking at each pair of variables, almost every pair has no correlation
whatsoever. Three pairs do stick out though that we can look into further.

$\bullet$ Clean_Fuel_Percent and Deaths_Per_100k (-0.902)
$\bullet$ GDP_Per_Capita and Deaths_Per_100k (-0.573)
$\bullet$ GDP_Per_Capita and Clean_Fuel_Percent (0.657)

Only 3 of the variables have some sort of correlation between them while the
other two (Year and Population) have almost zero correlation to any other
variable, which could be expected.

```{r}

# Each of the variables plotted against each other to see closer how they relate
# Correlation value is in the parenthesis
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
plot(pollution_deaths$Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent, pollution_deaths$Deaths_Per_100000, xlab = "Clean Fuel Access %", ylab = "Deaths per 100k", main = "Clean Fuel vs. Deaths ~ (-0.902)")
plot(pollution_deaths$GDP_Per_Capita, pollution_deaths$Deaths_Per_100000, xlab = "GDP per Capita", ylab = "Deaths per 100k", main = "GDP vs. Deaths ~ (-0.573)")
plot(pollution_deaths$Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent, pollution_deaths$GDP_Per_Capita, xlab = " Clean Fuel Access %", ylab = "GDP per Capita", main = "Clean Fuel vs. GDP ~ (0.657)")

```

From the pairs of variables with correlation, two have negative and one has postive.

Clean Fuel vs. Deaths per 100k sees almost a perfect negative correlation. So,
as clean fuel access goes up, deaths go down which gives us further insight and
verification that cleaner fuels is fact the way to go. And, since we have a -0.900
coefficient, their relation is very strong and that is seen in plot 1.

As for the other two, their correlations are around the ~0.500 mark, showing there
is some pull between each variable but it isn't very strong.

Looking deeper into each of these three plots, there are some outliers that stick
out and make the trend look funky. So, let's take a look into the data sets to
see if we can sniff out what those data points relate to.

```{r}

country_above_400 <- pollution_deaths %>%
     filter(Deaths_Per_100000 >= 400) %>%
     pull(Country)

   # Print the result
   print(country_above_400)

```

Looking into plot 1 to see where the Deaths per 100k go above 400, we see that
the Solomon Islands have the highest death rate out of all the countries and 
it is an outlier from the rest.

```{r}

clean_fuel_above_400 <- pollution_deaths %>%
     filter(Deaths_Per_100000 >= 400) %>%
     pull(Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent)

   # Print the result
   print(clean_fuel_above_400)
   mean(clean_fuel_above_400)
   
```

As it is easy to see from the graph that the Solomon Islands do not have a high
clean fuel access by any means, we see in numbers that the mean access percent
is ~7.47%.

What else can we find about the Solomon Islands ?

```{r}

solomon_islands <- pollution_deaths %>%
     filter(Country == "Solomon Islands")
solomon_islands

```

A simple overview shows what we already know about the low clean fuel access. But,
as the years go on their clean fuel access has actually increases every year,
showing they are heading in the right direction. With this, their population
has also increases steadily every year. Let's do another pairs plot to see the
full spectrum of these variables.

```{r}

Deaths_Per_100k_S <- solomon_islands$Deaths_Per_100000
Clean_Fuel_Percent_S <- solomon_islands$Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent

model_S = glm(formula = Deaths_Per_100k_S ~ Year * Clean_Fuel_Percent_S * 
    GDP_Per_Capita * Population, family = "poisson", data = solomon_islands)

ggpairs(model_S, columns = c(1,2,3,4,5), upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 5))) +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 8),
        strip.text.y = element_text(size = 5.5))

```

There is almost perfect positive or negative correlation between all of these
variables. All of which are the correlation direction that they need to be.

Fuel Access Percent and Year have 0.995, which is amazing to see for this country
as they are clearly striving to be better year in and year out. Another one is
their GDP is increasing as clean fuel becomes more accessible.

So, while the Solomon Islands may be an outlier in Deaths per 100k, their world
becomes better and better every single year and hopefully in the future they
can start to exponentially increase their clean fuel access.

```{r}

solomon_model <- glm(solomon_islands$Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent ~ solomon_islands$Year)

# In the year 2050..

year_2050 = -260.36 + 0.1334*(2050)
year_2050

# In the year 2075..

year_2075 = -260.36 + 0.1334*(2075)
year_2075

# In the year 2100..

year_2100 = -260.36 + 0.1334*(2100)
year_2100

```

This also will apply to plot 2 with the outliers being much higher than the rest.

How about the blip in plot 3 with the data going up and then back down ? What is
that all about ?

```{r}

hump_data <- pollution_deaths %>%
    filter(Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent <= 40) %>%
    filter(Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent >= 20) %>%
    filter(GDP_Per_Capita >= 16) %>%
    pull(Country)

hump_data

```

Using the same process as we did to find the Solomon Islands, we find that
Equatorial Guinea is the country with this weird hump in their GDP data.

The new question at hand is: what is the cause of this GDP bump that Equatorial
Guinea went through ?

```{r}

guinea <- pollution_deaths %>%
    filter(Country == "Equatorial Guinea")

Deaths_Per_100k_G <- guinea$Deaths_Per_100000
Clean_Fuel_Percent_G <- guinea$Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent

model_G = glm(formula = Deaths_Per_100k_G ~ Year * Clean_Fuel_Percent_G * 
    GDP_Per_Capita * Population, family = "poisson", data = guinea)

ggpairs(model_G, columns = c(1,2,3,4,5), upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 5))) +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 7.5),
        strip.text.y = element_text(size = 5))

```

The pairs plot doesn't give anything that would guide us in the right direction.
Population and Clean Fuel go up as the year increases but GDP sees a noticeable
decline. My theory would be an outside reason as to why this is happening. Trade
maybe ?

This finding will also correlate to plot 2 in the bump that is seen in GDP vs Deaths.
This will be ignored.

We will leave this alone and move on with our analysis and move to a more broad
question.

How is this data divided up and do we see more variance from different countries.

```{r}

pollution_deaths %>%
  count(Country)

```

With the 181 countries apart of the data set, only a few have less than 17 instances..

$\bullet$ Afghanistan
$\bullet$ Djibouti
$\bullet$ Nauru
$\bullet$ Sao Tome and Principe
$\bullet$ Somalia

This could happen due to cleaning of the data where some spots where left blank
so they were left out of the full data set. So, from the raw data, it seemed like
every country had 17 instances which tells us no country has a real strangle
hold of the data and there is no further reason to go deeper.

Next we will look at how population is and the range in which it inhibits.

```{r}

coun_7000 <- pollution_deaths %>%
  filter(Population > 6000) %>%
  pull(Country)
coun_7000

coun_1500 <- pollution_deaths %>%
  filter(Population > 1000) %>%
  filter(Population < 4000) %>%
  pull(Country)
coun_1500

coun_100 <- pollution_deaths %>%
  filter(Population <= 100) %>%
  pull(Population)

hist(coun_100, xlim = c(0,100), breaks = 50, main = "Histogram of Countries <= 100000 people", xlab = "Population (1000)")

```

Before going into the population divide, a couple outliers made it difficult
so they had to be pulled and identified so we could continue. The "World", at
population 7000, or 7 billion, was removed along with India and China, which sat
between 1000 and 1500.

Looking at our new histogram with the data we want, we see that the majority of
data is still under pop = 10, or 10,000 people.

```{r}

coun_10 <- pollution_deaths %>%
  filter(Population <= 10) %>%
  pull(Population)

hist(coun_10, xlim = c(0,10), breaks = 50, main = "Histogram of Countries <= 10000 people", xlab = "Population (1000)")

```

Now at a max of 10,000 people, we see the data is pretty evenly seperated besides
the very left where within 0.2 still sees the highest frequency.

This could lead us to looking at the range 0 to 3 to maybe 7 to 10 to see how the
two ranges compare to each other. After we can throw India and China in to see how 
different they are from the first two groups.

```{r}

# Group 0 to 3 (0 to 3000 people)
pop_0_3 <- pollution_deaths %>%
  filter(Population <= 3)

# Group 7 to 10 (7000 to 10000 people)
pop_7_10 <- pollution_deaths %>%
  filter(Population >= 7) %>%
  filter(Population <= 10)

# China and India
pop_CI <- pollution_deaths %>%
  filter(Population >= 800) %>%
  filter(Population <= 1800)

a <- count(pop_0_3)
b <- count(pop_7_10)
c <- count(pop_CI)
abc <- c(a,b,c)
abc

```

For fun we see the amount of instances each group sees which was expected. But now
we can compare all 3 groups to see how different each one is from each other.

```{r}

# Population 0 to 3 pairs plot
Deaths_Per_100k_0 <- pop_0_3$Deaths_Per_100000
Clean_Fuel_Percent_0 <- pop_0_3$Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent

model_0 = glm(formula = Deaths_Per_100k_0 ~ Year * Clean_Fuel_Percent_0 * 
    GDP_Per_Capita * Population, family = "poisson", data = pop_0_3)

ggpairs(model_0, columns = c(1,2,3,4,5), upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 5))) +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 7.5),
        strip.text.y = element_text(size = 5))

# Population 7 to 10 pairs plot
Deaths_Per_100k_7 <- pop_7_10$Deaths_Per_100000
Clean_Fuel_Percent_7 <- pop_7_10$Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent

model_7 = glm(formula = Deaths_Per_100k_7 ~ Year * Clean_Fuel_Percent_7 * 
    GDP_Per_Capita * Population, family = "poisson", data = pop_7_10)

ggpairs(model_7, columns = c(1,2,3,4,5), upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 5))) +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 7.5),
        strip.text.y = element_text(size = 5))

# Population China and India pairs plot
Deaths_Per_100k_C <- pop_CI$Deaths_Per_100000
Clean_Fuel_Percent_C <- pop_CI$Clean_Fuel_Access_Percent

model_C = glm(formula = Deaths_Per_100k_C ~ Year * Clean_Fuel_Percent_C * 
    GDP_Per_Capita * Population, family = "poisson", data = pop_CI)

ggpairs(model_C, columns = c(1,2,3,4,5), upper = list(continuous = wrap("cor", size = 5))) +
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 7.5),
        strip.text.y = element_text(size = 5))
```

Before anything is looked at, reminder that pairs plot 3 (China and India) only
have 2 countries and not as much data at models 1 and 2 so results from model 3
will be different.

It might be a little hard to go back and forth to see what is really going on
but here are the main differences between the three groups.

As for groups 1 and 2, there is really no difference in correlation coefficients.
The only thing that can be commented on though is that group 2 hada higher value
in every instance than group 1, that being toward 1 or -1.

For group 3 compared to groups 1 and 2, population was a huge difference that
really boosted the correlation values between population and everything else, 
which once again was to be expected because they both have 1B+ people. Other
big changes came from..

$\bullet$ Year ~ Deaths per 100k
$\bullet$ Clean Fuel ~ Year
$\bullet$ GDP ~ Year

.. which once again could be expected because these two countries are fully
developed so their population and GDP would be exponentially higher than third
world and developing countries.

So, where does this leave us with this data ?

No where really. The group of China and India were fully expected to be this way
so their data can be ignored. As for group 1 and 2, the key thing to take away
from that comparison is that further developed countries (7000 to 10000) people
had better correlation coefficients than that of group 1 (0 to 3000) people. This
shows that with more resources and money that countries will continue to prosper
and be cleaner.

From this EDA process, the main takeaways that were found are that developed countries
are obviously going to have the resources to have clean fuel and be healthier for
its people to live in. Countries like the Solomon Islands still have some work to
do but from their data they are continuing to go in the right direction, which
is always a great sign. And while their population numbers and GDP per capita will
be lower, as long as they continue to develop then the access to clean fuel
also continues to grow. For a nation like Equatorial Guinea, their data gave us a
reason to look into their name but all that came about was a foreign affair that
had nothing to do with our question.

Our last look in at the different groups of countries to see how their data
sets aligned all told one thing. Each group continues to grow at their own pace
but each has a positive correlation from year to clean fuel access and that is
what is important in the context of our problem.
